>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

beacause my computer may have problem and all my data will be gone, so, keep all my work on local is not a good idea. Beside that, i can use another computer, or someone else can make changes to my work easily.

>Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because i may want to change something before i pull it to my local, and i may also want to check the file that someone else create before i pull.
