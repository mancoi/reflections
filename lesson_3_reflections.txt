>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

beacause my computer may have problem and all my data will be gone, so, keep all my work on local is not a good idea. Beside that, i can use another computer, or someone else can make changes to my work easily.

>Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because i may want to change something before i pull it to my local, and i may also want to check the file that someone else create before i pull.

>Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork create a copy on GitHub, Clone create a copy on GitHub to your computer, branches create a another version of your work.

Fork:
	-use when you want to create a copy of someone's to your GitHub (because you dont have right to make changes to their work,etc.).
Clone:
	-make a copy of another work to your local.
	-You can clone a work on the same computer (maybe like change the spot of its), clone a work of someone on GitHub, or clone a work that you forked (to create a remote automatically).
Branches:
	-when you want to make change to your work but not want to touch the original version.

>What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

we can work on its offline and modified its offline like solve conflict, etc.
